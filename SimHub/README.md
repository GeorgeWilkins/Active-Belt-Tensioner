# SimHub Files
There are two files in this directory:
- [Device.js](Device.js): The raw JS script that you can tweak to customise your tensioner's behaviour
- [Device.shsds](Device.shsds): An importable SimHub-specific file that automatically configures the 'Custom Serial Device' for you, including the JS code above and the various settings sliders that control torque settings

If you import the latter file you will still need to select the correct 'Serial Port' for your device; but everything else should be good to go.
