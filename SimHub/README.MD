# SimHub Files
There are two files in this directory:
- [Device.js](Device.js): The raw JS script that you can tweak to customise your tensioner's behaviour
- [Device.shsds](Device.shsds): An importable SimHub-specific file that contains not only the JS code above, but preconfigured 'Custom Device' settings

If you're manually setting up a [Custom Device]() in SimHub, manually copy the contents of the JS file into its settings within the SimHub UI. Otherwise, just import the SHSDS file within SimHub.
