# Aluminium Parts
The [SVG](/Parts/Aluminium/SVG) and [DXF](/Parts/Aluminium/DXF) files within this directory are a reference for the only fabricated aluminium part in the design (of which we need two); the cooling plates. I designed the part to be easily made from a standard 1/4x1" bar with basic tools. You could have it cut from 1/4" sheet, but then you may as well redesign the part to take advantage of CNC fabrication.

Ideally you'd print this out at 1:1 scale and use it as a template to mark out the bar before cutting it to length, shaping the ends and drilling the holes.

Note that the inner two holes for the braking resistors will likely be in the wrong place for your resistors. They are not required _at all_ if you're using thermal adhesive to attach them to these plates.
