# Stacked Acrylic Parts
The [SVG](/Parts/SVG) and [DXF](/Parts/DXF) files within this directory are suitable for cutting from 3mm acrylic sheet, then being glued together into a number of distinct parts:
- **Front Panel**: The fascia visible at the front of the tensioner, separated from the rest of the body by 40mm aluminium spacers
- **Rear Panel**: The main boydy of the tensioner, to which the motors are bolted
- **Pulley (x 2)**: Bolt onto the motor hubs and hold/wind the 2mm steel wire, sitting behind the _Front Panel_
  - Note that each pulley must be kept in two pieces to allow the steel wire to be fitted and removed
- **Protoboard Tray**: Holds the protoboard PCB in place
- **Belt Loop (x 2)**: Attaches the steel wire to 2" seat belts

Each file's name indicates the sheet thickness and quantity required.
