# Stacked Acrylic Parts
The [SVG](/Parts/Acrylic/SVG) and [DXF](/Parts/Acrylic/DXF) files within this directory are suitable for cutting from 3mm acrylic sheet, then being glued together into a number of distinct parts:
- **Front Panel**: The fascia visible at the front of the tensioner, separated from the rest of the body by 40mm aluminium spacers
- **Rear Panel**: The main body of the tensioner, to which the motors and truss clamps are bolted
- **Pulley (x 2)**: The attachments to the motors around which the steel wire wraps (_don't glue these together_; or at least keep each pulley in two halves to allow insertion and removal of the steel wire)
- **Protoboard Tray**: Holds the protoboard PCB in place behind the motors
- **Belt Loop (x 2)**: Attaches the steel wire to standard 2" seat belts

Each file's name indicates the sheet thickness and quantity required.
